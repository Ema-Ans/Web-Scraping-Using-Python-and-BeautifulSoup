# Web-Scraping-Using-Python

Links I found useful:
BeautifulSoup documentation:
https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/
Extracting all links:
https://www.techgeekbuzz.com/blog/how-to-extract-all-website-links-in-python/
For tables:
https://www.projectpro.io/recipes/scrape-table-from-webpage-beautiful-soup#mcetoc_1g8v36ihf8

In general, you have to inspect the website and if you are extracting for certain you can play around
with find_all() method and different parameters, to get your desired results.

I was aiming to obtain all the unique ID's mentioned on the table with their reference links.
